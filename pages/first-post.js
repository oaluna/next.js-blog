    <h1>My Journey Into Tech</h1>
    <h2>From Hiding Being Self-Taught to an Actual Job in Tech</h2>{' '}
    <p>
      Before I begin this lengthy, insane story, let me start by saying that if
      you, the reader, are in a situation that makes obtaining a career in tech
      seem like a lofty goal, I ask that you slap yourself in the face and in
      your best Cher voice, say to yourself, "Snap out of it!" Read my story and
      then reflect on your own capabilities of making a desired change in your
      life.

      It isn't uncommon to hear about unconventional backgrounds when hearing
      stories from other web developers. My unconventional background, I feel,
      can be more appropriately described as haphazard. I'm a college dropout
      who dedicated his twenties trying to find stardom as a dancer while
      supporting this dream with multiple jobs as a cafe cashier. I had stars in
      my eyes and tech was nowhere in sight in my radar.
